# Workshop Agenda

## Phase 1: Introduction & Q&A ( 30 – 45 min )
- Presentation:
  - Overview of different types of software testing
  - Brief explanation of TDD (Test-Driven Development)
  - Introduction to pair programming
- Open Q&A session
  - Participants can ask questions about testing concepts, TDD, and pair programming

## Phase 2: Practical Exercises ( 1 – 1.5 h )
### Independent Practice
- Goal: Participants work individually to apply concepts
- Task:
  - Complete unit tests for **CommentService**
  - Ensure all methods are properly covered
  - Focus on clean, maintainable test code

### Pair Programming Exercise
- Goal: Hands-on experience with collaborative unit testing
- Method:
  1. One participant proposes how a test or implementation should be done
  2. The other participant writes the test/implements the code
  3. Roles are rotated continuously
- Task:
  - Write unit tests for **PostService** collaboratively
- Focus:
  - Discuss edge cases
  - Practice effective collaboration and communication

### TDD Demonstration
- Instructor demonstrates TDD on **TextService**
  - Write tests first
  - Implement methods to pass tests
  - Refactor as needed

### Independent TDD Practice
- Goal: Participants practice TDD on their own
- Task:
  - Apply TDD approach to **CalculatorService**
  - Write tests → implement → refactor
  - Practice multiple scenarios and edge cases
